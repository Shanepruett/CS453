OVERVIEW:

 It is with a heavy heart that I must admit defeat by
 this project. This project is supposed to be a simple character
 driver that supports the open, read, and write operations.
 At the moment the only thing this driver can do is load and unload
 without an error that I've noticed. The rest of the operations 
 are merely stubs of their potential glory. I discuss some of the
 issues I had in the Discussion section. 


INCLUDED FILES:

 booga.c	This is the main file that has the device driver
 booga.h	This is the header file for booga.c
 booga_load	This is the provided loader for the driver.
 booga_unload	This is the provided unloader for the driver.
 booga.wav	This was provided, I'm assuming it's a sound file.
 Makefile	This is the makefile used compile the driver
 README		This document.
 booga-test.c	This is the provided test file, it is unedited.


BUILDING AND RUNNING:

 To compile this application type the follow from the terminal:
 $ make

 To load the device driver type the following from the terminal:
 $ sudo ./booga_load

 To unload the device driver type the following from the terminal:
 $ sudo ./booga_unload

 To test the device driver while it is loaded type the following:
 $  test-booga <minor number> <buffersize> <read|write>
 

PROGRAM DESIGN:

 My device driver barely loads correctly. Currently it is missing
 the semamphore, though technically it doesn't need one yet because
 the device driver doesn't have any updating structures yet.

 This is clearly one of the areas where I struggled the most.
 I don't understand how the device driver is supposed to print the
 streams of characters when using the read option without calling
 standard C library functions. 

 TESTING:

 I test my program by loading it and unloading it and using the 
 /sbin/lsmod command to check it if was loaded and unloaded. I also
 tested several ways of implementing the read function to return
 a stream. It's not done using the printk function. When i tried
 using the buf parameter in from the function call My system ended up
 crying and needing restarted. 

 My device driver does not work. Despite my best efforts to work up
 slowly all it can do is load and unload. Which by the way I celebrated
 hardily. 


DISCUSSION:
 
 This might be the first time I've been utterly defeated by a project
 at every step of the way.

 My first major hangup was that I didn't make enough time early on, and
 I didn't have enough time later on either. 

 My second major hangup was that I spent an entire day rebuilding my 
 virtual machine kernel after it innexplicably decided to no longer work
 on my computer. 

 My third hangup was that I simply don't have a good understanding of what
 is happening with this device driver. I don't understand what a major and 
 a minor are. I think the /sbin/lsmod command is similar to a task manager,
 or atleast that's what I hope is true. I'm confused how the read function
 called in the test file has only three parameters but the read function in
 my device driver has four. I don't understand how device driver has four
 minors (though i don't understand what that is) even though I never actually
 create the four minors. I do however know it IS doing it because when I spent
 four hours trying to get my device drivers to load I kept getting an error
 when I loaded them that said the four minors didn't exist. Turns out I was
 only missing the functions at the end of the file that set the init and exit
 function. 

 My current goal is to figure out what all of this means before the next project
 is leaves me in the dust.
